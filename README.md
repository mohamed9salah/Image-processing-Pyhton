This project demonstrates the application of bitwise operations (AND, OR, XOR, and NOT) in image processing using Python. The operations are applied to both black and white pictures as well as colored pictures. Additionally, the project includes code for mask detection.

Features
Bitwise AND Operation: Combines two images at the pixel level using the AND operation.
Bitwise OR Operation: Combines two images at the pixel level using the OR operation.
Bitwise XOR Operation: Combines two images at the pixel level using the XOR operation.
Bitwise NOT Operation: Inverts the colors of an image.
Mask Detection: Implements mask detection on images using bitwise operations.
Technologies Used
Python
OpenCV
